# KrkrSharp

Krkr# (KirikiriSharp) is a project to perform krkr2/krkrz's behaviours in managed way. It' not really aimed to to perfectly run krkr games in .NET Runtime. (But you are welcomed to join us and achieve it :) ) It's used to inspect krkr's principles and mechanisms.

Original introduction: .NET parser for kirikiri KAG/TJS visual novel scripting languages (super WIP)

It's based on `KirikiriSharp` by `planetarian` which is based on `krkr-cs` by `fantasydr` which is based on `kirikirij (habakiri)` which is translated from `kirikiri2` by `Takenori Imoto (楓 software)`.
